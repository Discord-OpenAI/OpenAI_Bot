Made by CoCFire#1111

Training data collection module for OpenAI model fine-tuning
I'm making it cuz I really need a better way to record the prompts used than the console log files lol
I'm also not at home, so I can't really work on it cuz I'm making it on mobile data and it's really kinda hard
Anyway, there's likely gonna be a shit ton of typos until I can actually get a chance to work on it on my pc
Until then, it's mostly pseudocode
